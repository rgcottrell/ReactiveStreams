# Examples

This is a collection of samples using [ReactiveStreams](https://github.com/rgcottrell/ReactiveStreams) for Swift.

The ReactiveStreams API is intended to be a low level interface to facilitate
interoperability between various implementations of the ReactiveStreams
interface.

These examples are intended to show how the low level interfaces can be used
to build up higher level abstractions.

## Requirements

Swift 3.0 development toolchain required.

## Notes

The following examples are designed to show off various aspects of the
Reactive Streams API and explore techniques that might be useful in
implementations of Reactive Streams.

These examples should be used as inspiration for applying Reactive Streams, but
should not be considered examples of correct implementation.
